# Build-a-Virtual-Private-Cloud
In this project, I will demonstrate how to build and configure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from scratch in AWS, including setting up networking components like subnets and internet connectivity. I’m doing this project to learn the fundamentals of AWS networking, how resources communicate securely within a VPC, basic cloud network architecture.
